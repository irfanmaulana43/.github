**Calobite** is a cloud-based application designed to help users to understand and manage their daily calorie intake. In this modern day, many people want to maintain a healthy diet but face many challenges, including accessing accurate nutritional information. ‘Calobite ‘provides a solution by offering a few features, one of which is calculating calories from ingredients and recipes, along with personalized recipe recommendations based on user's preferences.<br>
Our problem statement is that access to calorie and nutritional information for everyday ingredients is limited, making it difficult for people to maintain a diet suitable to their needs.
We have a few research questions, such as; How can cloud technology and machine learning improve access to calorie information? Can this application effectively provide recipe recommendations aligned with user preferences? <br>
Our goal is to use technology to help people be healthier. We're building an app that will give each user-specific advice. This advice will be based on their individual needs, and it will include information about how many calories they should eat and what kind of foods they should eat.
